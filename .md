# Pf test

## The design
- Stack used: Laravel 9, Inertia JS, VueJS 3, Tailwind
- Optimal environment to use: PHP 8, MySQL 5.7
- This web app is designed to function as a Single Page App, hence the use of Inertia JS to help achieve that. 
- Fourth item
- The models used are 
    - User
    - Notification
    - UserNotification (pivot table)
- On a larger scale, this many to many model design may not scale well, but it's sufficient for this exercise.
- This is using https://apilayer.com/marketplace/number_verification-api#documentation-tab for phone verification (100 free credits per month).
- The phone verification is performed at the edit and new user function.
- As per requirement, there is no authentication built into this web app and hence are open to anyone with access to it.

## Enhancement consideration
- Cache some data for lighter load on the server
- Push some jobs to queue to improve load distribution and reduce response time
- Institute more microservices to better support at a larger scale
- Log file for API calls for audits

## To test
- Unzip or clone the git to your machine
- Create a new database
- Copy from .env.example to .env and update your database configuration based on the database from previous step
- Run on terminal:-
    - $composer install
    - $php artisan key:generate
    - $chmod -R 777 storage
    - $chmod -R 777 bootstrap/cache
    - $php artisan migrate
    - $php artisan db:seed
- Go to /admin/users to find the users list
- Go to /admin/notifications to find the notifications list
- You may impersonate via the Impersonate option on the users list as well as from the name label in the notifications list
